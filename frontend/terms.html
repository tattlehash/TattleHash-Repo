                <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>TattleHash is a <strong>cryptographic attestation service</strong> that creates blockchain-anchored proof of peer-to-peer transactions and agreements.</p>

                <h3>What TattleHash IS:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An attestation and evidence-creation service</li>
                    <li>A platform for recording timestamped, immutable proof of what was attested</li>
                    <li>A tool that creates records designed to be admissible and persuasive in legal proceedings</li>

                    <li><strong>NOT financial advice</strong> - We are not financial advisors; consult a professional for financial matters</li>
                    <li><strong>NOT a guarantee of legal outcome</strong> - Admissibility of evidence varies by jurisdiction</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Service Tiers</h2>
                <p>TattleHash offers four attestation tiers:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>

                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Solo</strong></td>

                            <td>Proof with counterparty notification and PDF dossier</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Gatekeeper</strong></td>
                            <td>Mutual co-signing between two parties</td>
                        </tr>

                </table>

                <h3>Enforced Tier Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>The Enforced tier <strong>verifies fund availability only</strong>. Specifically:</p>

                    <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> expose, reveal, or record actual account balances</li>
                    <li>The verification is a simple pass/fail: "sufficient funds available" or "insufficient funds"</li>
                    <li>No balance information is stored, transmitted, or visible to any party</li>
                </ul>
                <p>TattleHash does NOT:</p>

                <h2>9. Beta Limits</h2>
                <p>During the beta period, the following limits apply:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                <p>These limits may be adjusted or removed at TattleHash's discretion.</p>

                <h2>10. Gamified Fee Splitting</h2>
                <p>Gatekeeper and Enforced attestations may include optional gamified fee determination (Coin Toss).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Results are determined using <strong>provably fair blockchain randomness</strong></li>
                    <li>Neither party can influence the outcome</li>
                    <li>The "sponsor" (party determined by the game) pays the full fee</li>
                    <li>The "sponsored" party pays nothing</li>
                    <li>Results are recorded in the attestation metadata and verifiable on-chain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are no "winners" or "losers" - one party sponsors the attestation.</p>

                <h2>11. Downgrade Policy</h2>
                <p>If a Gatekeeper or Enforced attestation is initiated and the counterparty does not respond within 72 hours:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attestation <strong>automatically downgrades to Fire</strong></li>
                    <li>The initiating user receives a <strong>credit refund</strong> for the difference:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gatekeeper to Fire: 3 credits refunded</li>
                            <li>Enforced to Fire: 9 credits refunded</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The user retains Fire-level proof (notification sent, PDF generated)</li>
